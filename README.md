  A simple game where you control Sonic through an infinite stage, is a fan-project created using HTML, CSS and JS, based on the 
  Dino Game from Chrome. <br><br>
 
  This project was created with love for the Sonic franchise, with no intended monetary values.<br>
  I hope I can still update the project with time, adding new playble characters, new stages, even new mechanics!<br><br>
 
 <h2> 🟦 How to Play 🟦 </h2>
 Press any key in your keyboard or click the screen to jump! <br><br>
 Pay attention to enemies position to be sure that you're safe and focus on surpassing your highscore!<br><br>
 
 <h2> 💠 Tips 💠 </h2>

```

```
```diff
  # You can't make any changes after starting a game, so be sure when to start!
  # On the PC, you can start without having to press the button, just by pressing a key! Both to Start and Restart...
```
