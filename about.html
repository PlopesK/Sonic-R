            <h1> Sonic-R </h1>
            <p> Sonic-R/Sonic Runner (you can choose how to call it), is a fan-project developted by 
                <a href="https://github.com/PlopesK">PlopesK</a> using HTML, CSS and JS, based on the 
                <a href="https://chromedino.com/">Dino Game</a> from Chrome. <br>
                This project was created with love for the Sonic franchise with no intended monetary values :D.<br>
                I hope I can still update the project with time, adding new playble characters, new stages, even new mechanics!
                So I hope everyone seeing this to have the best fun possible playing this "website game" :)<br><br>
            </p>
            <h2> Development </h2>
            <p> The idea of the project is very simple, but it demanted a lot of work since I didn't really was customized with
                the JS logic (I already had a lot of knowledges about HTML and CSS), so it was really useful to motivate me to study more. <br>
                The problem really was that I had to create and adapt a new logic to the game, being really different to an 'copy/paste' project,
                Demanding to use only my logic to create it. <br>
                Searching for others dinosaurs games in the internet, for example, use mainly the 'canvas' element, with I choosed to not use
                (since when I discovered his existency, the project was already in a really long way, so probrably 
                I would have to recode everything :,v ). <br><br>

                Even if it isn't the most well-coded project in existance, neighter the most impressive or something a-like.
                But, I'm certain that I learned a lot producing it :), and it's a love letter from a fan to others fans of the Sonic franchise .
                So, I hope others can find something useful in it or have fun playing it :D.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h2> Sprites </h2>
            <p> There's only an section focused on sprites because I wanted to clarify how annoying was to cut and implement those graffics :,).
                I had to searching by the internet and recort every-single-sprite manually to recreate the stages and actions made by the characters. <br>
                For that, I used the <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel website</a> to create every gif and even modify some sprites to work in the project. <br>
                Most of the sprites where cutted from <a href="https://www.sega.com/games/sonic-hedgehog">
                Sonic the Hedgehog 1</a>, but the Sonic model is a mix between every sprite of Sonic from the
                <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Advance">Sonic Advance Series.</a> <br>
                Most of the recorted spritesheets were downloaded from the 
                <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/genesis_32x_scd/sonicth1/sheet/27190/"> Spriters Resource 
                website </a>, so a lot of thanks to everyone who uploaded those sprites, since that helped a lot :D. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2> Curiositys </h2>
            <p> Both Sonic-R and Sonic Runners are already existing Sonic games! <br>
                <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/Sonic_R">Sonic-R</a> was a racing game developed for Sega Saturn and ported to many collections of games from the franchise, for example the Sonic Gems Collection for Playstation 2.
                As a kid I played it a lot and loved everything about it, even if the critics didn't liked it that much :,v. <br><br>
                <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Runners">Sonic Runners</a> was an free mobile game that ended 
                service for the creation of <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Runners_Adventure">
                Sonic Runners Adventure</a>, a paid mobile game with didn't made that much success. <br>
                It's really sad that it ended that recently after lauching :,v. It was a really fun experience, 
                would be glad if it returned someday. But, even if it didn't returned officially, Sonic Runners received 
                an fan-project called <a href="https://sonicrunners.com/#/">Sonic Runners Revival</a>, wich is an 
                amazing work made by fans to recreate Sonic-Runners :D.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p> The project itself demanded a lot of hard work to be created (but still, it was really fun to develope),
                 so I really hope you had atleast a bit of fun playing it :D<br>
