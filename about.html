                </a>
                <p> Sonic-R/Sonic Runner (you can choose how to call it), is a fan-project developted by 
                    <a href="https://github.com/PlopesK">PlopesK</a> using HTML, CSS and JS, based on the 
                    <a href="https://chromedino.com/">Dino Game</a> from Chrome. <br><br>
                    This project was created with love for the Sonic franchise, with no intended monetary values.<br><br>
                    I hope I can still update the project with time, adding new playble characters, new stages, even new mechanics!<br><br>
                </p>
                <h2> Development </h2>
                <p> The idea of the project is very simple, but it demanted a lot of work since I wasn't used to the JS 
                    logic (I already had a lot of knowledges about HTML and CSS), so it was really useful to motivate me 
                    to study more! <br><br>

                    To develop the project, first I searched a lot to see how different ways people recreated the Dino game from Chrome,
                    so, instead of copying one and just changing specific lines, I decided to try and create my own logic for this game.
                    (so probrably the code isn't writed in the best way possible, since I'm technically only a beginner using JS).<br><br>

                    <img src="sprites/badnik2.gif" style="width:26vh; height:15vh;" id="flyenemy" title="Buzz Bomber (Sonic the Hedgehog 1)">
                    <div class="extramessage"> Creating the mechanic for the obstacles was the most difficult </div><br><br>
                
                    Even if it isn't the most well-coded project, neighter the most impressive or something a-like, I'm still proud with the result!
                    And I'm certain that I learned a lot producing it :) <br><br>
                    
                    The project is mainly a love letter from a fan to others fans of the Sonic franchise! 
                    It demanded a lot of hard work to be created (but still, it was really fun to develope),
                    so I hope others can find something useful in it or have fun playing :D<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> <center><div class="transition"> üíìLifesüíì </div></center>
                    The first idea of the game was to have 1 life (just like the Dino Game).<br>
                    But then I had the idea to change that to 3, since it would make the game more enjoyable (in my opinion ‡∂û).<br><br>
                    In the beginning, the life system would be indicated by 'Rings' instead of 'Lifes', and an animation would be activated when you had only 1 life<br>
                    
                    <img src="sprites/rings-low.gif" title="Your rings are low!" alt="Rings Low" style="width: 15vh; border-radius: 0;">
                    <img src="sprites/life-icon.gif" title="Lifes Icon" alt="Lifes Icon" style="margin-left: 10vh; width: 15vh;">
                    <div class="extramessage"> <- Before and After -> changing idea </div> <br><br>

                    I changed it because it didn't made sense... Like, in the Sonic Franchise you don't lose 1 Ring per hit,
                    you lose <b>ALL</b> of them with 1 hit. So changing it for Lifes would be more accurate!<br><br>
                    Maybe at some point i'll add a rings system. Who knows?<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> <br><center><div class="transition"> üêûObstaclesüêû </div></center>
                    The obstacles system is based more in an 'random value' than just getting faster with time!<br><br>
                    I made it like that because (in my opinion ‡∂û) it would be more fun to have to be prepared all the 
                    time for a attack than just having to wait till the obstacles are fast enough to be challenging.<br>

                    <img src="sprites/gameover-sonic.gif" title="You lose :(" alt="Game Over!" style="width: 25vh;"> <br>

                    Hope everyone can enojoy it more like that too!<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> <br><center><div class="transition"> üÜôDouble JumpüÜô </div></center>
                    The Double Jump mechanic wasn't intended at first! <br><br>
                    It would only be later added because of, at some points, how enemies would completelly cover your passage,
                    forcing the player to take a hit... <br><br>
                    
                    The second reason was because (in my opinion ‡∂û) a Double Jump mechanic would turn the game more enjoyable,
                    just because the player would have different mobilitys options!<br><br>

                    <img src="sprites/sonic-previous-idle.gif" class="sonic" title="Sonic Previous-Idle"><br>
                    <div class="extramessage"> This was the first idle animation added to Sonic!<br>
                    Changed it because the new one fits better. </div> <br>

                <h2> Sprites </h2>
                <p> There's only an section focused on sprites because I wanted to tell how annoying was to cut and implement those graffics :,) <br><br>
                    <img src="images/sprite-print.jpg" style="width:95%;" title="Piskel print, animating one of the stage background objects"><br>
                    <div class="extramessage"> Drawing new sprites is <u>A LOT</u> less annoying than having to cut them, even when considering the animating process  </div><br><br>

                    I had to install and cut every single sprite manually to recreate the stages and actions made by the characters. <br>
                    For that, I used the <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel website</a> to create every gif and even modify some sprites to fit the project. <br><br>

                    Most of the sprites where cutted from <a href="https://www.sega.com/games/sonic-hedgehog">
                    Sonic the Hedgehog 1</a>, but the Sonic model is a mix between many sprites of Sonic from the
                    <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Advance">Sonic Advance Series</a> and <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Battle">
                        Sonic Battle</a> <br><br>

                    Most of the spritesheets were downloaded from the 
                    <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/genesis_32x_scd/sonicth1/sheet/27190/">Spriters Resource 
                    website</a>, so a lot of thanks to everyone who uploaded those sprites, since that helped a lot :D <br><br>
                </p>
                <p> <br><center><div class="transition"> ‚ö´Shadow‚ö´ </div></center>
                    All Shadow animation had a lot of frames, but the worst to create was the run animation...<br>
                    Like, it has <b>28 Frames</b>, it's <i>A LOT</i>.<br>

                    <img style="width: 30vh;" src="images/shadow-run.png" title="Chaos Control!" alt="Shadow Run Animation">
                    <div class="extramessage"> Sprite Sheet </div> <br>

                    <div class="extramessage"> Result </div> <br>
                    
                    It was really painful to create this character since all sprites were taken from <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/sonicbattle/sheet/10045/">
                    Sonic Battle</a>...<br>
                    But since he's one of my favorites, it was worthy to do :) <br><br>
                </p>

                <p> <br><center><div class="transition"> üå∑Amyüå∑ </div></center>
                    Amy double jump animation was taken from <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/sonicbattle/sheet/10042/">
                    Sonic Battle</a>! Since she has the hability to double jump in game. <br>

                    <img src="sprites/Amy/amy-doublejump.gif" title="My Sweet Passion!" alt="Amy Double Jump Animation" class="sonic">

                    Most Meatl Sonic sprites were taken from a Hackroom of Sonic 2! In this hackroom, you can play as 
                    Metal Sonic in the game (since it wasn't possible in the original game)! <br>

                    <img src="sprites/MetalSonic/metalsonic-idle.gif" title="Destroy Sonic!" alt="Metal Sonic Idle Animation" class="sonic">
                    <div class="extramessage"> This idle animation is from the start of his battle in Sonic CD </div> <br>

                    But still, there's sprites taken from Sonic CD! Sprites that I had to modify the color scheme to fit 
                    the same vibrant colors from the hackroom...<br>

                <h2> Curiosities </h2>
                <p> Both Sonic-R and Sonic Runners are already existing Sonic games! <br><br>
                    <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/Sonic_R">Sonic-R</a> was a racing game developed for Sega Saturn and ported to many collections of games from the franchise, for example the Sonic Gems Collection for Playstation 2.
                    As a kid I played it a lot and loved everything about it, even if the critics didn't liked it very much :,( <br><br>

                    <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Runners">Sonic Runners</a> was an free mobile game that ended

                    Sonic Runners Adventure</a>, a paid mobile game with didn't made that much success. <br><br>

                    It's really sad that it ended 1 year after lauching :,/. It was a really fun experience, 
                    would be glad if it returned someday. But, even if it didn't returned officially, Sonic Runners received 
                    a fan-project called <a href="https://sonicrunners.com/#/">Sonic Runners Revival</a>, wich is an

                    The 'Character Select' menu background is based of the same menu on <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/sonicbattle/sheet/10818/">
                    Sonic Battle</a>!<br>
                    <img style="width: 40vh;" src="images/charselect.png" title="Choose your character!" alt="Character Select">
                    <img style="width: 40vh;" src="images/charselect-dark.png" title="Choose your character!" alt="Character Select" >
                    <div class="extramessage">  <- 'Blue' Mode || 'Dark' Mode -></div> <br>
                    The Dark Mode version is an edit made by me! (I think it looked very dope lol‡∂û).<br><br>

                    The 'Select a Character' was an edit made by me based on the 'Please Select a Player Character' 
                    from Sonic Advance 3!<br>

                    Plus, I recorded <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/sonicadv/sheet/6600/">
                    Sonic and Tails life icons</a> to add to the image! Just to look cooler.<br>

                    Furthermore, the 'Stage Select' image was taken from <a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_CD">Sonic CD</a> port for PC!<br>

                    The 'Coming Soon' sprite is taken from <a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Advance">Sonic Advance 1!</a><br>
