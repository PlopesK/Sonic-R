                <p> Sonic-R/Sonic Runner (you can choose how to call it), is a fan-project developted by 
                    <a href="https://github.com/PlopesK">PlopesK</a> using HTML, CSS and JS, based on the 
                    <a href="https://chromedino.com/">Dino Game</a> from Chrome. <br><br>
                    This project was created with love for the Sonic franchise, with no intended monetary values.<br><br>
                    I hope I can still update the project with time, adding new playble characters, new stages, even new mechanics!<br><br>
                </p>
                <h2> Development </h2>
                <p> The idea of the project is very simple, but it demanted a lot of work since I didn't really was customized with
                    the JS logic (I already had a lot of knowledges about HTML and CSS), so it was really useful to motivate me to study more. <br><br>

                    To develop the project, first I searched a lot to see how different ways people recreated the Dino game from Chrome,
                     so, instead of copying one and just changing specific lines, I decided to try and create my own logic for this game.
                    (so probrably the code isn't writed in the best way possible, since I'm technically only a beginner using JS).<br><br>

                    <img src="sprites/badnik2.gif" style="width:26vh; height:15vh;" id="flyenemy" title="Buzz Bomber (Sonic the Hedgehog 1)">
                    <div class="extramessage"> Creating the mechanic for the obstacles was the most difficult </div><br><br>
                
                    Even if it isn't the most well-coded project, neighter the most impressive or something a-like, I'm still proud with the result!
                    And I'm certain that I learned a lot producing it :) <br><br>
                    
                    The project is mainly a love letter from a fan to others fans of the Sonic franchise, 
                    it demanded a lot of hard work to be created (but still, it was really fun to develope),
                    so, I hope others can find something useful in it or have fun playing :D<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> <center><div class="transition"> üíìLifesüíì </div></center>
                    The first idea of the game was to have 1 life (just like the Dino Game from Chrome).<br>
                    But then I had the idea to change that to 3, since it would make the game more enjoyable (in my opinion ‡∂û).<br><br>
                    In the beginning, the life system would be indicated by 'Rings' instead of 'Lifes', and an animation would be activated when you had only 1 life<br>
                    
                    <img src="sprites/rings-low.gif" title="Your rings are low!" alt="Rings Low" style="width: 15vh; border-radius: 0;">
                    <img src="sprites/life-icon.gif" title="Lifes Icon" alt="Lifes Icon" style="margin-left: 10vh; width: 15vh;">
                    <div class="extramessage"> <- Before and After -> changing idea </div> <br><br>

                    I changed it because it didn't made sense... Like, in the Sonic Franchise you don't lose 1 Ring per hit,
                    you lose <b>ALL</b> of them with 1 hit. So changing it for Lifes would be more accurate!<br><br>
                    Maybe at some point i'll add a rings system. Who knows?<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> <br><center><div class="transition"> üêûObstaclesüêû </div></center>
                    The obstacles system is based more in an 'random value' than just getting faster with time!<br><br>
                    I made it like that because (in my opinion ‡∂û) it would be more fun to have to be prepared all the 
                    time for a attack than just having to wait till the obstacles are fast enough to be challenging.<br>

                    <img src="sprites/gameover-sonic.gif" title="You lose :(" alt="Game Over!" style="width: 25vh;"> <br>

                    Hope everyone can enojoy it more like that too!<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> <br><center><div class="transition"> üÜôDouble JumpüÜô </div></center>
                    The Double Jump mechanic wasn't intended at first! <br><br>
                    It would only be later added because of, at some points, how enemies would completelly cover your passage,
                    making it obrigatory to take a hit... <br><br>
                    
                    The second reason was because (in my opinion ‡∂û), a Double Jump mechanic would turn the game more enjoyable,
                    just because the player would have different mobilitys options!<br><br>

                    <img src="sprites/sonic-previous-idle.gif" class="sonic" title="Sonic Previous-Idle"><br>
                    <div class="extramessage"> This was the first idle animation added to Sonic!<br>
                    Changed it because the new one fits better. </div> <br>

                <h2> Sprites </h2>
                <p> There's only an section focused on sprites because I wanted to tell how annoying was to cut and implement those graffics :,) <br><br>
                    <img src="images/sprite-print.jpg" style="width:95%;" title="Piskel print, animating one of the stage background objects"><br>
                    <div class="extramessage"> Drawing new sprites is <u>A LOT</u> less annoying than having to cut them, even when considering the animating process  </div><br><br>

                    I had to install and cut every single sprite manually to recreate the stages and actions made by the characters. <br>
                    For that, I used the <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel website</a> to create every gif and even modify some sprites to work in the project. <br><br>

                    Most of the sprites where cutted from <a href="https://www.sega.com/games/sonic-hedgehog">
                    Sonic the Hedgehog 1</a>, but the Sonic model is a mix between many sprites of Sonic from the
                    <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Advance">Sonic Advance Series</a> and <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Battle">
                        Sonic Battle</a> <br><br>

                        <img src="sprites/sonic-idle.gif" class="sonic" title="Sonic Idle">  
                        <img src="sprites/sonic-damage.gif" class="sonic" title="Sonic Taking Damage"> 
                        <img src="sprites/sonic-jump.gif" class="sonic" id="jumped" title="Sonic Jumping">
                        <img src="sprites/sonic-doublejump.gif" class="sonic" id="djumped" title="Sonic Double Jump">

                        <img src="sprites/sonic-run.gif" class="sonic" title="Sonic Running"> <br><br>

                    Most of the spritesheets were downloaded from the 
                    <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/genesis_32x_scd/sonicth1/sheet/27190/">Spriters Resource 
                    website</a>, so a lot of thanks to everyone who uploaded those sprites, since that helped a lot :D <br><br>
                </p>

                <h2> Curiosities </h2>
                <p> Both Sonic-R and Sonic Runners are already existing Sonic games! <br><br>
                    <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/Sonic_R">Sonic-R</a> was a racing game developed for Sega Saturn and ported to many collections of games from the franchise, for example the Sonic Gems Collection for Playstation 2.
                    As a kid I played it a lot and loved everything about it, even if the critics didn't liked it that much :,(. <br><br>

                    <div class="extramessage"> I really love this Sonic model, he's just so adorable lol</div> <br><br>

                    <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Runners">Sonic Runners</a> was an free mobile game that ended 
                    service for the creation of <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Runners_Adventure">
                    Sonic Runners Adventure</a>, a paid mobile game with didn't made that much success. <br><br>

                    It's really sad that it ended 1 year after lauching :,/. It was a really fun experience, 
                    would be glad if it returned someday. But, even if it didn't returned officially, Sonic Runners received 
                    an fan-project called <a href="https://sonicrunners.com/#/">Sonic Runners Revival</a>, wich is an 
                    amazing work made by fans to recreate Sonic-Runners!<br><br>
